This Python project utilizes OpenCV to perform facial detection in images. The application analyzes input images to identify human faces and generates output images with bounding boxes drawn around each detected face.

#Functionality
The program implements computer vision techniques to:

Process image data for facial recognition
Apply Haar cascade classifiers or similar detection algorithms
Identify and locate facial features within the image
Draw rectangular bounding boxes to highlight detected faces
Output modified images with visual indicators of face locations
#Applications
This tool can serve as a foundation for various computer vision applications including:

Security and surveillance systems
User authentication mechanisms
Photography applications
Human-computer interaction systems
#Technical Implementation
The project leverages OpenCV's robust image processing capabilities and pre-trained detection models to efficiently identify facial patterns in digital images with minimal computational overhead.
