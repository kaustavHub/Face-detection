# Face-detection
# Face Detection with OpenCV  This Python script uses OpenCV to detect faces in images. When a face is found, it generates a new image with a rectangle around the face. The project applies computer vision techniques to accurately identify and highlight facial features, making it useful for security, photography, and interactive applications.
